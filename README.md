# PostMan-MongoDB-Search-Save

This MongoDB-Atlas , PostMan branch will have a code having Schema(Model), Routes, and Server as a Project. Also I have used PostMan(mainly the GET and POST method) to fetch and save data in MongoDB Atlas.

Note: In this project we can search the data usig any of the value(SyncID,userID,_id etc..._)  

``Import the branch and open code in VS code then run command in the inbuilt terminal use command npm install/npm i to install all the packages required if not installed then go for manually installing the pakcages``  Then Run the server, Go to PostMan create the required API's and check the functionlity.

Steps of Installing the project with other requirement:
Create a folder api --> inside that create two more folders with following name:
1. model --> place the file Digitap(having Schema included in it)
2. routes --> place the file Digitap(having Router included in it)

After placing all the file use the command node server.js //// or Install(npm install -g nodemon)--> then run command nodemon server.js(if we change anything the server will start automatically.

In Postman create the GET and POST as per requirement and then use the Body as per requirement.
