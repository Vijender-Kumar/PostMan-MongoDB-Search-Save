# PostMan-MongoDB-Search-Save
This MongoDB-Atlas , PostMan branch will have a code having Schema(Model), Routes, and Server as a Project. Also I have used PostMan(mainly the GET and POST method) to fetch and save data in MongoDB Atlas. ``Import the branch and open code in VS code then run command in the inbuilt terminal use command npm install/npm i to install all the packages required if not installed then go for manually installing the pakcages``  Then Run the server, Go to PostMan create the required API's and check the functionlity.
